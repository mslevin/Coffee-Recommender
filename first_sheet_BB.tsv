Blue Bottle	17ft Ceiling Espresso		Effulgent, caramelly, enveloping, nutty	We developed this espresso blend for our café on Mint Plaza in downtown San Francisco. This is a pleasant, consistent espresso – enjoyable without being demanding – plump with unremarkable complexity. What is remarkable, however, is the sweet simplicity owing to the fact that we reverse-engineered a blue-collar Italian espresso blend (yes … robusta!) and substituted higher-end organic coffees. Our goal was a robust, crema-heavy, unpretentious coffee. If the Hayes Valley espresso can be like consuming a volume of In Search of Lost Time in liquid form, then the 17ft ceiling is like flipping through the New Yorker – edifying without being taxing. The baristas at the café updose massively, set the PID two or three degrees hotter than the Hayes Valley espresso (typically 202 F on the GB5), and pull leisurely, avuncular 35 second shots, often skipping the first few drops. Served with a water back, of course.
Blue Bottle	Bella Donovan	Ethiopia, Sumatra, Peru 	Heavy, comforting, deeply-fruited	The Bella is the wool sweater of our blends -- warm, comforting, familiar. Wild and citrusy organic African paired with earthy organic Indonesian makes for a vivid and fairly complex Moka/Java blend. It seems to weather the rigors of the automatic drip machine as well. This is, perhaps, why it's our most popular blend. It is also on the darker side: nice and thick without being inelegant. Bella stands up to milk or cream well, and is easily enjoyed black.
Blue Bottle	Brazil FAF Carmel Yellow Catuai Natural	Brazil	Toffee, pecan, vanilla	In the 12 years since Maria Angela Loguercio Bouskela and her two children purchased land in Brazil’s Minas Gerais region, their passion for agriculture and sustainability has transformed Carmel Vivá into a thriving farm. We were lucky enough to visit the family at their property last year. They’re very excited to be part of Blue Bottle’s coffee line-up, and we’re excited to introduce you to this sweet, subtly fruity coffee. This naturally-processed coffee has notes of caramel and vanilla that remind us of coming home from school as kids to a kitchen that smelled like freshly-baked cookies. It makes us feel like skipping the humdrum of homework to go jump rope or throw the Frisbee, until the streetlights come on and it’s time for dinner.
Blue Bottle	Colombia Huila El Playón	Colombia	Butterscotch, blood orange, bay leaf	Jesús Alberto Barrera, like many of his neighbors in Timaná, Huila, owns a small but fruitful coffee farm high up in the Andes Mountains. Growing the Caturra coffee variety, the rainy weather in Huila provides a nearly endless crop, so Jesús is harvesting coffee 10 months a year. El Playón will arm you for any adventure, whether it’s a weekend of camping with friends or a spontaneous road trip to see the world’s largest yo-yo (or whatever suits your fancy). Brew. Enjoy its butterscotch, blood orange, and bay leaf notes. Take on the world. Rinse your mug. Repeat.
Blue Bottle	Decaf Noir	Mexico, Sumatra	Versatile, incisive, vivid	A water process decaf that is vivid and packed with flavor, Decaf Noir is made from 100% organic water processed decaffeinated beans from Mexico and Sumatra. If you drink it strong, store it carefully and use it up quickly (buy a smaller amount and try to use it up in a week), you will be rewarded with very big flavors. The decaf Noir is surprisingly (some say freakishly) versatile: about the only preparation we don’t see consistently enjoyable results in is the siphon.
Blue Bottle	Giant Steps		Viscous, fudgy, substantial	A blend of organic coffee that is quite dark and chocolaty. Maybe a bit more one-dimensional than the Bella Donovan, but it is a good dimension. Giant Steps is delightfully fudgy and thick in a French press or drip pot, and stands up to cream quite well. If it were any heavier-bodied, you could pour it on pancakes.
Blue Bottle	Hayes Valley Espresso		Cocoa, orange zest, smoky finish	We developed this espresso over five years ago for the launch of our Kiosk on Linden Street. This is probably our darkest espresso: lower-toned, minimal brightness, plenty of chocolate – with an engaging complexity as a straight shot. The shots are gorgeous: achingly heavy with voluptuous red-brown crema, and the silky, somewhat dangerous-looking viscosity of a power-steering stop-leak product once used on our (now departed) heroically battered 1983 Peugeot. In milk, it tastes like chocolate ovaltine, and holds its own from the daintiest 3oz Macchiato to our towering 12oz caffe latte. This is the most Brahmsian espresso we have. Brooding and autumnal, it is a coffee to mourn the passing of time.
Blue Bottle	Honduras Santa Elena Jose Hernandez	Honduras	Cocoa, red apple, clean	Catracha is a community of smallholder farmers, established five years ago by Mayra Orellana-Powell, who wanted to support and showcase the coffee producers in the region of Honduras where she grew up. The plots of land in this area are relatively small, but the producers make up for the lack of volume with a focused dedication to quality. The result of their hard work is this sweet, clean coffee, with sublime notes of apple and cocoa.
Blue Bottle	Opascope Espresso		Fig, honey, floral, lime	What’s in a name? Well, we’ve always been fans of the opascope, a beautiful tool for projecting handwriting and finely rendered artwork onto a larger surface. We could blab for hours about its quaint design, its bulky contours, its place in our childhood classrooms. But for expediency’s sake, let’s put it this way: The opascope is a tool for taking careful craftsmanship and opening it up for everyone to access and enjoy. Sound familiar? Available only in the Bay Area and online, the three-component Opascope Espresso is a refreshing addition to a lineup once dominated by dense, chocolatey selections. It yields an effervescent shot, packed with stripes of tropicalia.
Blue Bottle	Rwanda Nyanza Kirezi	Rwanda	Apricot, tangerine, honey	Hailing from a 2000-member cooperative in the Nyanza district, Kirezi embodies pretty much everything we love about Rwandan coffees—in fact, we love it so much that we buy all of it. Since water is such a precious resource in the region, the co-op utilizes water-efficient technology and careful monitoring to ensure the coffee’s sustainability and superior quality.
Blue Bottle	Sulawesi Tana Toraja Toarco	Sulawesi	Cranberry, lemon, sage	Sulawesi, one of Indonesia’s four Greater Sunda Islands, is also the 11th largest island in the world. High, mountainous slopes are covered with lush green rice paddies that are a stark contrast to its active volcanoes. Sulawesi’s coffees are beloved, but finding spectacular ones can be a challenge, especially due to fluctuations in production caused by climate change. Sulawesi is brighter and sparkles with the sweetness of cranberries, tempered by citrus and the earthy, herbaceous flavor of sage. Warning: This coffee may make you grab your passport and book that trip to Bali and Southeast Asia you’ve been dreaming about.
Blue Bottle	Three Africans	Ethiopia, Congo	Fruity, radiant, creamy	This coffee is generally a blend of Congolese and two different Ethiopians coffees. Together, these components produce a big, chocolaty aroma and excel in just about every prep method, save espresso and siphon. Unlike some of our fancy-shmancy single origins, this blend has a very easy-to-like personality, good body, unthreatening complexity, and a reasonably clean aftertaste. The coffees—two Ethiopians, one dry-processed and one wet processed; and a wet-processed Congolese—leave subtle imprints of dried blueberries and cardamom. A fairly dark roast, this inclusive blend will take milk or cream well. Some say damn well.
Chromatic	Voyager	Ethiopia, Colombia	Cosmic, Luminous, Dense	Out of this world exploration into a spectrum of the Milky Way! We launch off with aromas of dried berries, and a gentle ginger brightness. The body is creamy, and flavors of dark chocolate nougat, caramel, and vanilla resonate throughout the cup. Go ahead and explore the possibilities of this coffee!
Chromatic	La Virgen	Colombia	Floral, spice, citrus	A classic in our offerings has returned this season, promising the lushious body and sweetness we come to expect from this small holders lot. A bouquet of flowers welcomes us in upon the first encounter, which then allows for the more spicy, like those found in baked goods, to come forth. Toward the end the cup finishes cleanly and smoothly with hints of citrus and caramel.
Chromatic	Encore		Smooth, Caramelized, Bakers Chocolate	Ever rotating coffees to maintain a darker profile with body and sweetness. Smooth, caramelized and Bakers chocolate make this a great year round blend.
Chromatic	Sidama Decaf	Ethiopia	Citrus, Syrupy, Blueberry, Berries, Honey	A clean and exciting decaf coffee with great berry like acidity reminiscent of fresh blueberries and lemon. The body is syrupy and sticky, but still light and refreshing, while orange flavors play with pickled ginger and fennel. Super yummy as a cold brew too.
Chromatic	Gamut Espresso	Brazil, Ethiopia, El Salvador	Chocolate, Creamy, Butterscotch	Gamut is our Flagship espresso. We pull this 365 days a year in our cafe and as the seasons change we adjust what comprises this blend to give it a creamy chocolate and butterscotch taste. Gamut's dense chocolate notes that punch through the milk is sure to make this a customer favorite. This espresso is made up of Keynote as a base, blended with a Latin American and an African coffee.
Chromatic	Keynote	Colombia	Dark Honey, Caramel, Fudge	A mellow, sweet, and approachable offering available year round. Comprised of rotating Single Origin offerings to maintain a specific taste profile. Some of the more subtle nuance will give some gentle floral aromatics that play well with the chocolate and roasted Spanish peanut flavors that are more prevalent in the cup.
Chromatic	La Loma	Mexico	Cane, Stonefruit, Grape	The newest coffee we have added to our line up, you can expect to be greetet by delicate aromas upfront, followed with the sweetness and flavor of cane sugar, gentle lemon chiffon, and a variety of stone fruit and grape flavors in finish.
